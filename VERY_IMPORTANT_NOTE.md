Dear Parallel Computing Instructor,

Please note that the linked article, "https://levelup.gitconnected.com/unveiling-two-dynamic-multi-threaded-web-servers-for-task-execution-62644e78a04a", is behind a paywall on the Medium platform.

Since Medium frequently restricts access to its high-quality content, it creates an obstacle for students who need to read the material. For future assignments, could you please provide the article using an alternative method that ensures unrestricted student access?
